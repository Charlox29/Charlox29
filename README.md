Hello !

I am @Charlox29 and I am a French high school student. I am very interested in development as well as programming,
and I specialize in robotics and home automation. My biggest projects are currently pythons programs (example: Bots Disords),
as well as SumoBots. So I know about electronics and arduino.

I'm mostly a math fan, because logic is my state of mind.
